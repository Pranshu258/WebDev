# Hyper Text Markup Language
Pranshu Gupta

HTML is the standard language used to write web pages, it describes the structure and content of the page using markup. There are different elements in HTML to create represent different components of the page. These elements are represented by HTML Tags. These tags may have attributes that specify additional properties of the component. 

The general outline of any HTML page is as follows:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Simple HTML Page</title>
            <!-- Other meta information, scripts and stylesheets -->
            <!-- This is a comment -->
        </head>
        <body>
            Content goes here !!!
        </body>
    </html>

The page generated by the browser looks like this:

## HTML Tags
All the components of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks etc. are described by a corresponding HTML tag. Each HTML document is enclosed with in the "html" tag. This tag contains two tags "head" and "body". The head tag can contain more tags that describe important information like the title, author, serach keywords, icon etc. of the page. 

`<title>Pranshu Gupta</title>`

`<meta name="description" content="Home Page">`

`<meta name="keywords" content="Pranshu, Gupta, IITK, iit">`

`<meta name="author" content="Pranshu gupta">`

`<link rel="icon" href="images/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />`

The head tag may also describe the scripts and stylesheets that are required for proper display and functionality of the page using the "script" and "link" tags. 

`<link href="includes/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet">`

`<script src="includes/js/modernizr-2.6.2.min.js"></script>`

Inside the body tag we describe the content of the page using the tags for headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks etc.

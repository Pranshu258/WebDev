## The Internet
The Internet is a network of networks of computers all over the world. It is an infrastructure that allows any two computers connected to the internet to communicate and share information with each other under some set of rules or protocols. HTTP, FTP, SMTP, IMAP etc are some of the protocols used on the internet.

## The World Wide Web
The World Wide Web is an information sharing model built on top of the internet. It is an information space which houses a huge collection of interlinked documents that can be accessed via the internet under HTTP.
Each document on the internet has an address which is required to locate it on the network, this address is called URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
These documents can also have other associated resources such as videos, images etc. The language used to create these documents is called HTML.

The World Wide Web is not synonymous to the internet, it is a part of the internet - a big part. Internet also contains other things like Email, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), DNS (Domain Name Service), TLS (Transport Layer Security) and other services,
